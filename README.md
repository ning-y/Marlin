# My Marlin configuration

This is my Marlin configuration, using [Marlin 2.1.2.2](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/tree/2.1.2.2) and adapted from [MarlinFirmware/Configurations](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Configurations/tree/release-2.1.2.2) (config/examples/Creality/Ender-3 V2/CrealityV422/MarlinUI); for an Ender 3 V2 with BLTouch (connected via dupont pins to a Creality V4.2.2 motherboard with RET6 [512K] chip).
